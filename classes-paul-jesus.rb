# As a developer, I can create a class called Task.

# class Task

# As a developer, I can create three instances (objects) of class Task. e.g laundry = Task.new

# As a developer, I can initialize each instance of class Task with a title.

# def initialize(task)
#     @task = name
# end


# As a developer, I can see the title of each instance of class Task.
# As a developer, I can initialize each instance of class Task with a status that has a default value of 'incomplete'.
# As a developer, I can update the status of each instance of class Task when the task has been completed.
# For the following ColorPalette challenge use initialize and attr_accessor methods in your class.

# As a developer, I can create a class called ColorPalette.
# As a developer, I can create three instances (objects) of class ColorPalette.
# e.g green = ColorPalette.new
# As a developer, I can initialize each instance of the class ColorPalette with three colors.
# e.g. green = ColorPalette.new('Chartreuse', 'Kelly', 'Seafoam')
# As a developer, I can print the value of each individual color.
# As a developer, I can create a method called all_colors that when called will print a sentence telling me the three colors of a given palette.
# As a developer, I can change one or more colors of a given palette.
